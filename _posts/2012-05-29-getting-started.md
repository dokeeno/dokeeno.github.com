First of all [get registered](http://dokeeno.com/user/login) for Dokeeno and get [logged in.](http://dokeeno.com/user/login)
Then you'll be able to see Dokeeno's dashboard as follow

![Dokeeno's Dashboard](/images/getting-started/screen-intro.png)

Main action you can do is tagged in the image. 

##1.Create or Select Application
Application in Dokeeno is ideal to the application you have. If you need to add Dokeeno support to your webapp, then you need an app on Dokeeno.

You can get started with default **Hello World** application or just click the **+** button and create a one.

##2.Integrate Dokeeno to your webapp
Dokeeno can be integrated with any kind of Webapp since dokeeno's integration is based on JavaScript. All you have to do is follow the instructions on the **integration** tab on our Dashboard.

It will take 10-20 min time to get integrated. You can even able to get the Dokeeno's functionality, if you are running your application on an intranet or a local machine.

##3.Create your product updates
After sucessfully integrated, click on the **Product Updates** tab and you'll see a screen like below

![Add Product Updates](/images/getting-started/product-updates.png)

There is two types of updates you can [add](/adding-a-product-update.html). They are Annoucements and Features.

###Annoucements
You can add site wide annoucement to your product. When a customer logged into your application we'll delever annoucements by order. 

###Features
You can add features and tips offered by your application in this section. Features also will be delivered by order to the customer. Annoucements get most priority when delivering. Features will be delivered only after each and every annoucement has beed develivered to the customer.

By default **only one** updates (annoucement or feature) will be delevered a day to a customer. (If you send too many, customer will get annoyed!)

##4.Test how your updates will get delivered
Dokeeno gives you a tool to simulate how these updates will be delivered to your customers. You can try it on your webapp if you've integrated it with Dokeeno. For that you need Dokeeno's **Debug Dev Tool**.

You can install the **Debug Dev Tool** by clicking on the **Dev Tools** tab in the Dashboard.
